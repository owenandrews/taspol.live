What does one do when the live stream of parliament on the official [Tasmanian Parliament website](http://www.parliament.tas.gov.au) isn't cross-browser compatible. Make your own of course!

This basic site simply uses [Video.js](http://videojs.com/) to play the HLS live streams from both the upper and lower house of the Tasmanian Parliament. Currently, only Safari supports HLS, so [videojs-contrib-hls](https://github.com/videojs/videojs-contrib-hls) is used to add crossbrowser support for HLS.
